Churn Insight and Prediction Engine

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict customer churn for e-commerce platforms. The solution identifies at-risk customers based on behavioral, demographic, and transactional data, helping businesses implement targeted retention strategies.
Project Overview

The Churn Insight and Prediction Engine uses a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a customer is likely to churn. The model was trained and tuned using customer behavior data, achieving strong performance with high precision and recall metrics. Key features like tenure, app usage hours, satisfaction scores, and transaction history contribute to the prediction.
Features

    Data Processing: Cleaned and preprocessed data with imputation and standardization.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key patterns and correlations.
    Model Training: Built and optimized using Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning.
    Model Interpretation: Leveraged SHAP values for interpretability.
    Deployment: Streamlit web application for real-time predictions.
